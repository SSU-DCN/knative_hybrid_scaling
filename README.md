# knative-hybrid-scaling

A Knative hybrid auto-scaling operator 

## Description
This operator take predicted traffic and pod's assigned resource level pairing with its corresponding optimal concurrency level as inputs

Inputs:
- Predicted Traffic is represented by TrafficStat Custom Resource produced by https://github.com/mipearlska/Predictive_TrafficStatCRD
- Resource-Optimal Concurrency pair of each service is represented by a ConfigMap

Example ConfigMap
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: service-a
data:
  resources-intensive-type: "cpu"
  required-resources: "200Mi"
  "cpu1": "concurrency1"  
  "cpu2": "concurrency2"
  "cpu3": "concurrency3"  
  "cpu4": "concurrency4"
```

Example TrafficStat Custom Resource
```
apiVersion: hybridscaling.knative.dcn.ssu/v1
kind: TrafficStat
metadata:
  name: service-a-traffictest
spec:
  servicename: service-a
  predictedinputtraffic: "100"
```
## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Knative cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/knative-hybrid-scaling:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/knative-hybrid-scaling:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
